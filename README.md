# Okta Quarkus Sample

This example shows you how to use the [Quarkus's OpenID Connect Adapter][] to login a user. The login is achieved through the [Authorization Code Flow][] where the user is redirected to the Okta-Hosted login page. After the user authenticates, they are redirected back to the application and a local cookie session is created.

It also shows how to return the user's information from an API using an OAuth 2.0 access token.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you will need the following:

* [Java 17+](https://sdkman.io/jdks)
* [The Okta CLI Tool](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli/#installation)
* An Okta Developer Account, create one using `okta register`, or configure an existing one with `okta login`

## Get the Code

Grab and configure this project using `okta start quarkus`.

You can also clone this repo and run `okta start` in it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-quarkus-sample.git
cd okta-quarkus-sample
okta start
```

## Enable Refresh Token

Sign into your [Okta Developer Edition account](https://developer.okta.com/login/) to add a required setting to your Quarkus Okta app to avoid third-party cookies. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and select "okta-quarkus-sample" application to edit. Find the **General Settings** and press **Edit**. Enable **Refresh Token** in the **Grant type** section. **Save** your changes.

## Run the Example

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Log in at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Access with OAuth 2.0

You can also retrieve user information from the `/hello` endpoint with an OAuth 2.0 access token.

First, you'll need to generate an access token.

1. Run `okta apps create spa`. Set `oidcdebugger` as an app name and press **Enter**.

2. Use `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to `https://oidcdebugger.com`.

3. Navigate to the [OpenID Connect Debugger website](https://oidcdebugger.com/).

    1. Fill in your client ID
    2. Use `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize` for the Authorize URI
    3. Select **code** for the response type and **Use PKCE**
    4. Click **Send Request** to continue

4. Set the access token as a `TOKEN` environment variable in a terminal window.

       TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM...

5. Test the API with [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) and an access token.

       http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"
